1. This is the stage when a new ticket is created. Two common ways in which tickets can be submitted is through a form – such as the one shown here – or by emailing an   email address that is designated for tickets. In this form, the user provides their contact information, the topic/issue, and details about the issue.

2. After the ticket has been submitted, the ticket can be assigned to an IT professional. In order for the ticket to be handled properly, information regarding the       level of severity can be changed.

2d. "Transfer" the IT Agent. The transfer would allow Agent to have a role which are the permission granted to Agents per Department that they have access to. Each       Role   has a set of permissions that can be checked/unchecked for agents given that Role in association with a Department they have access to. An unlimited number of   roles   can be created and assigned to Agents with access to various departments.

3. Now that the ticket has been assigned to the appropriate department and people, the IT staff can work on finding a solution to the issue. Each time a change is made    to the ticket or there is an update to the situation, a comment can be made in the Ticket Thread. This allows everyone viewing the ticket to be aware of what has      already happened and facilitates communication between everyone involved.

4. Once the issue has been resolved, the ticket can be closed. In the osTicket system, the ticket will move from the Open section to the Closed section in this stage. For IT professionals, it is important to know where to find closed tickets since they can be browsed and used to find solutions to open tickets.
