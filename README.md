<p>
This is the stage when a new ticket is created. Two common ways in which tickets can be submitted is through a form – such as the one shown here – or by emailing an email address that is designated for tickets. In this form, the user provides their contact information, the topic/issue, and details about the issue.

After the ticket has been submitted, the ticket can be assigned to an IT professional. In order for the ticket to be handled properly, information regarding the level of severity can be changed.
